### 🔍 "Uncovering insights, one dataset at a time."

Hi, I’m Kenny! From oil and gas pipelines to data pipelines, I’ve always been about flow—whether it’s oil, gas, or raw data transforming into insights. Now, instead of designing intricate networks of pipes, I design machine learning models, analytics dashboards, and data-driven strategies that fuel business decisions. Data tells a story, and I make sure it flows in the right direction! 🚀📊
